# GitLabAnnex â€” adding extra functionality to GitLab Community edition

This project is an angular application that provides extra functionality to the already awesome GitLab Project - community edition.

The aim here is to provide extra functionality like:

- Task filter:
	tickets should be filterable by a bunch of parameters
	- dates, user, status, milestone
- Exporter
	- export to excel,pdf
- Table Results
	- use datatables (might solve the export bit as well, donno yet)
- Config
	- setup connection url, private-token for connection, etc
- Issue Notification and Subscription
	- subscribe to ticket(s) to know when activities happen on them
- Graphical Stats on status of things
